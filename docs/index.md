# What is Flagpole?

*"Let me run it up the flagpole first"*

Running something up the flagpole means you check on it first to see if it's good before going forward. And that's exactly what this framework is about, so we like the analogy. 

Flagpole is a flexible framework that can support a number of different types of testing:

* Full browser testing with Puppeteer
* Super-fast HTML DOM testing with Cheerio (jQuery for Node)
* REST API/JSON End Points
* Lightweight image tester that can verify the dimensions, mime and file size without downloading the whole thing
* Stylesheets including basic CSS validation
* Basic validation for other resources like JavaScript

Flagpole is designed to be simple so that the most junior engineer or QA analyst can pick it up within hours.

Flagpole is designed for portability, so that you can run it locally within your repository from a githook, in the cloud when something is deployed, as a scheduled job, or manually any time you want.

Flagpole has a rich CLI that can be used to list tests, run tests, create new suites or scenarios, etc.

# Getting Started

First thing we need to do is install Flagpole with npm. Go into the root of your project and run this:

```bash
npm i flagpole -g
npm i flagpole --save-dev
```

The above command installs it both locally (within the project) and globally. This is a little annoying that we have to do both. But we do. Globally is so that the command "flagpole" will run. The second one is so that your test suites can find it.

If you want to also use Puppeteer in your project install it as well, as a dev dependency.

```bash
npm i puppeteer --save-dev
```

You should be able to run the flagpole command now, which will give you instructions on how to use the CLI.

```bash
flagpole
```

Pretty colors, eh?

Now let's initialize our project

```bash
flagpole init
```

Once you answer those questions, you should have a flagpole.json file. Now we need to create our first test scenario.


```bash
flagpole add suite
```

Answer those questions and it will set up your first test file. Now let's make sure. If we run this command you should see it listed.

```bash
flagpole list
```

We should be able to run this very basic test with:

```bash
flagpole run
```

Sweet! How about we actually do something with the test now and run it. So open that test file that was generated by our "add suite" command earlier and add this into the next callback:

```typescript
this.assert('HTTP Status equals 200', response.status().equals(200);
```

Now run the flagpole run command again...

```bash
flagpole run
```

And if we did everything right, then you should see something like:

```text

## Assertions

Create an assertion within your scenario's "next" blocks like this:

```
this.assert(myValue)
```

This alone does nothing, since it just creates the assertion object with the value you want to assert against. But it hasn't actually asserted anything. So use one of the methods below.

### Methods

#### between

Works for numbers, but also casts strings to numbers for the compare. Tests if this value is between the minimum and maximum.

```
this.assert(myValue).between(0, 10);
```

#### contains

Tests whether the input value contains the argument. This works for strings, arrays, and even for objects. If it's an object, it checks if a property exists with that value.

```
this.assert('foobar').contains('foo');
```

#### endsWith

Tests whether the input value ends with the argument. Also works with arrays, testing whether the argument is the last value of the array.

```
this.assert('foobar').endsWith('bar');
```

#### equals

This be used with any types of values. It uses a rough (double equals) equality versus the exactly method that uses a precise (triple equals) equality.

```
this.assert(myValue).equals(5);
```

#### every

Loops throught the input value, which should be an array, and checks them against the callback function to be sure that every one is true.

```
this.assert(['eminem', 'dre', 'ice cube']).every((rapper) => {
  return rapper.indexOf('e') >= 0;
})
```

#### exactly

This asserts an exact match with precise (triple equals) equality.

```
this.assert(myValue).exactly(5);
```

#### exists

Tests whether the input value is not null or undefined. This works well for selecting a DOM Element and then testing if it actually existed (since it returns null if not).

```
this.assert(await this.select('article')).exists();
```

#### greaterThan

Works for numbers, but also casts strings to numbers for the compare.

```
this.assert(myValue).greaterThan(5);
```

#### greaterThanOrEquals

Works for numbers, but also casts strings to numbers for the compare.

```
this.assert(myValue).greaterThanOrEquals(5);
```

#### in

Tests whether the input value is in the array of possible values.

```
this.assert('2pac').in(['2pac', 'biggie', 'daz']);
```

#### includes

Tests whether the input array includes the argument.

```
this.assert(['2pac', 'biggie', 'daz']).includes('2pac');
```

#### lessThan

Works for numbers, but also casts strings to numbers for the compare.

```
this.assert(myValue).lessThan(5);
```

#### lessThanOrEquals

Works for numbers, but also casts strings to numbers for the compare.

```
this.assert(myValue).lessThanOrEquals(5);
```

#### like

Like is a more fuzzy match. It ignores type differences and also trims whitespace and compares strings all lowercase. So it indicates the values are similar, but not necessarily equal.

```
this.assert(myValue).like('FooBar');
```

#### matches

Regular express compare of strings.

```
this.assert(myValue).matches(/^[a-z0-9]{3,32}$/i);
```

#### none

Loops throught the input value, which should be an array, and checks them against the callback function to be sure that none are true.

```
this.assert(['2pac', 'biggie', 'daz']).none((rapper) => {
  return rapper == 'snoop';
})
```

#### rejects

Tests whether the input promise rejects.

```
await this.assert(myPromise).rejects();
```

#### resolves

Tests whether the input promise resolves.

```
await this.assert(myPromise).resolves();
```

#### some

Loops throught the input value, which should be an array, and checks them against the callback function to be sure that at least one is true.

```
this.assert(['dre', 'snoop', '2pac']).some((rapper) => {
  return rapper.indexOf('e') >= 0;
})
```

#### startsWith

Tests whether the input value starts with the argument. Also works with arrays, testing whether the argument is the first value of the array.

```
this.assert(['foo', 'bar']).startsWith('foo');
```

### Properties

In addition to the methods to make the assertions, you can change them by chaining these properties.

#### length

This causes the assertion to evaluate the length of the input value, rather than the actual value. This works for anything that supports length including strings and arrays. For other things it will cast the input to a string and evaluate it.

```
this.assert('foobar').length.equals(6);
```

#### not

Flips the assertion to be the negative of itself.

```
this.assert(5).not.equals(6);
```

#### optional

This makes the assertion consider optional, meaning its failure won't cause the entire scenario to fail. If it passes, it will be listed as a pass. If it fails, it will be shown as failing in a special type of comment. That way you can see it, but not hold up the deploy because of it.

```
this.assert(5).optional.equals(6);
```

#### type

This causes the assertion to evaluate the type of the value, rather than the actual input value. The type will always be a lowercase string. It is a smart typeof that can tell things like 'promise' and 'regexp' that might otherewise evaluate to plain old object.

```
this.assert(5).type.equals('number');
```
