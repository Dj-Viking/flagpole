                <h2>What is Flagpole JS?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>"Let me run it up the flagpole first"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running something up the flagpole means you check on it first to see if it's good before going forward. And that's
                    exactly what this framework is about, so we like the analogy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flagpole is a flexible framework that can support a number of different types of testing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Full <strong>browser</strong> testing with Puppeteer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Super-fast <strong>HTML DOM</strong> testing with Cheerio (jQuery for Node)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>REST API/JSON</strong> End Points
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lightweight <strong>image</strong> tester that can verify the dimensions, mime and file size without downloading the whole thing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stylesheets including basic <strong>CSS</strong> validation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Basic validation for other resources like <strong>JavaScript</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Flagpole is designed to be simple so that the most junior engineer or QA analyst can pick it up within hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flagpole is designed for portability, so that you can run it locally within your repository from a githook, in the cloud
                    when something is deployed, as a scheduled job, or manually any time you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flagpole has a rich CLI that can be used to list tests, run tests, create new suites or scenarios, etc.

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    First thing we need to do is install Flagpole with npm. Go into the root of your project and run this:
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    npm i flagpole -g
                    npm i flagpole --save-dev
                </code>
                <p>
                    The above command installs it both locally (within the project) and globally. This is a little annoying that we have to
                    do both. But we do. Globally is so that the command "flagpole" will run. The second one is so that your test suites can
                    find it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to also use Puppeteer in your project install it as well, as a dev dependency.
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    npm i puppeteer --save-dev
                </code>
                <p>
                    You should be able to run the flagpole command now, which will give you instructions on how to use the CLI.
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    flagpole
                </code>
                <p>
                    Pretty colors, eh? Now let's initialize our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you prefer to watch, rather than read, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d29m9eg7AV4">video walkthrough</a> of
                    getting started.
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    flagpole init
                </code>
                <p>
                    Once you answer those questions, you should have a flagpole.json file. Now we need to create our first test scenario.
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    flagpole add suite
                </code>
                <p>
                    Answer those questions and it will set up your first test file. Now let's make sure. If we run this command you should
                    see it listed.
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    flagpole list
                </code>
                <p>
                    We should be able to run this very basic test with:
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    flagpole run
                </code>
                <p>
                    Sweet! How about we actually do something with the test now and run it. So open that test file that was generated by our
                    "add suite" command earlier and add this into the next callback:
                </p>
                <code class="typescript">
                    this.assert('HTTP Status equals 200', response.status().equals(200);
                </code>
                <p>
                    Now run the flagpole run command again...
                </p>
                <code class="bash">
                    flagpole run
                </code>
                <p>
                    And if we did everything right, then you should see something like:
                </p>
